# Ray-Tracing Simulation

This project presents a 2D ray-tracing simulation that models the propagation of waves from a 5G base station within the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET). The simulation aims to analyze signal behavior and coverage within the museum's environment.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To simulate the propagation of 5G signals inside the MET museum using a 2D ray-tracing approach.
- **Methodology**: The simulation traces the paths of waves emitted from a base station, accounting for interactions with the museum's architecture.
- **Tools Used**: Developed using MATLAB for computational modeling and visualization.
